# Use Cases README

* This directory contains the use cases of iDispatchX, grouped by primary actor.
* Use cases must be consistent with the C4 specifications and all Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs).
* Use cases do not repeat NFRs.
* Use cases must reference relevant NFRs when behavior is constrained.
* Use cases describe normal and exceptional flows.
  * They describe observable behavior, not implementation.
  * Exceptional flows may include degraded modes as defined in the Availability NFR.
* One use case = one primary actor + one goal.
* If required behavior is unclear or not specified, do not invent it; ask for clarification.
