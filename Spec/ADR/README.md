# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for iDispatchX.

ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, the chosen solution,
and the alternatives that were considered.

## Purpose

ADRs exist to capture *why* the system is designed the way it is, especially when:

* Multiple reasonable alternatives exist
* The decision has long-term architectural impact
* The rationale may not be obvious from code or diagrams

## Scope

ADRs may cover decisions related to:

* Technology choices
* Development and deployment practices
* Architectural constraints and trade-offs
* Testing and operational considerations

ADRs do **not** override Non-Functional Requirements or C4 specifications.
In case of conflict, NFRs and C4 documents take precedence.

## Stability

ADRs are historical records.

If a decision changes, a **new ADR** must be added describing the updated decision.
Existing ADRs must not be modified to reflect new decisions.
